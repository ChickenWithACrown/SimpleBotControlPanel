# SimpleBotControlPanel
A simple control panel to remote access NodeJS Discord Bots

If you want to test it, download the repository, extract into a folder somewhere, and run start_server.bat

Navigate to http://localhost:3000

Put the path to your bot into the Bot Folder Path

Click start and your bot **should** run from it, watch the console!

Note: Dont forward the port in your router to access it somewhere outside of your network yet as it currently doesn't have any type of security
